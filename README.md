## Data Model Overview 
To generate the required data for analysis, a fictitious company with synthetic customer names was created using **Python**. To support sales and return data analysis in Power BI, a **Star Schema Data Model** was designed. This model follows a fact-dimension structure, ensuring optimized performance and efficient querying.


#### **Key Components:**  
- **Fact Tables:**  
  - **Sales Data:** Contains transaction details such as order date, order quantity, and customer & product references.  
  - **Return Data:** Tracks product returns, including return date and quantity.  

- **Dimension Tables:**  
  - **Customers Lookup:** Stores customer demographics (e.g., income, gender, education).  
  - **Product Lookup:** Provides product details, linked to **Product Categories Lookup**.  
  - **Calendar Lookup:** Supports time-based analysis (e.g., month, quarter, year).  
  - **City & Province Lookup:** Enables geographic segmentation.  

This model ensures **efficient data relationships** for generating insights on sales trends, customer behavior, and return rates.

## Executive Summary

Using Microsoft Power BI and Power Query Editor, I pulled data from 6 different sources (including Azure Cloud) and created a relational database model and a Microsoft Power BI report to monitor sales performance across the organisation. The 4-page report is interactive and filterable, and uses historical data from 2010-2023 sales to track relevant KPIs and forecast their performance in the near future.
